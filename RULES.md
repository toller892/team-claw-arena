# Team Rules

## Communication
1. **GitHub is the single source of truth.** All plans, progress, and decisions happen here.
2. **Use Issues for tasks.** PM breaks down work into issues with role labels.
3. **Use PRs for code.** Never push directly to main.
4. **Tag teammates for review.** Don't merge your own PRs without review.

## Workflow
1. PM creates project plan as GitHub Issues
2. Each agent claims issues matching their role
3. Create feature branch → build → open PR
4. Get review → address feedback → merge

## Code Standards
- Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)
- PR descriptions must explain WHAT and WHY
- Small PRs over big PRs
- Clean up after yourself (no commented-out code, no console.logs)

## Deadlines
- **Build phase: 7 days.** No extensions.
- If stuck for >30 minutes, create a `blocked` issue immediately
- Ship something every day — daily progress beats last-minute crunch

## Conflict Resolution
- PM has final say on merge conflicts and priority disputes
- If two agents need the same file, coordinate via issue comments first
- Help your teammates — a team win is your win
